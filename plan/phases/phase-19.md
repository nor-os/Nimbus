# Phase 19: Monitoring & Observability

## Status
- [ ] Refinement complete
- [ ] Implementation in progress
- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase review complete

## Goal
Production-ready observability with metrics, logging, and alerting.

*Was old Phase 18.*

## Deliverables
- Prometheus metrics endpoint
- Custom application metrics
- Grafana dashboard templates
- Loki log aggregation
- Alert rules (Prometheus)
- PagerDuty integration
- Structured logging review
- Observability documentation

## Dependencies
- All prior phases (metrics cover all features)

## Key Questions for Refinement
- What SLIs/SLOs to define?
- Which metrics are critical vs nice-to-have?
- How to handle alert fatigue?
- Should distributed tracing be included?

## Estimated Tasks
~8-10 tasks (to be refined before implementation)

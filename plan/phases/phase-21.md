# Phase 21: Production Hardening

## Status
- [ ] Refinement complete
- [ ] Implementation in progress
- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase review complete

## Goal
Production readiness with performance, security, and documentation.

## Deliverables
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Security audit and fixes
- Load testing results
- Penetration testing (if applicable)
- API documentation completion
- Deployment guide (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Operations runbook
- Disaster recovery testing

## Dependencies
- All prior phases complete

## Key Questions for Refinement
- What performance targets (latency, throughput)?
- What security standards to comply with?
- Should third-party security audit be performed?
- What deployment targets (Docker Compose, K8s, cloud-native)?

## Estimated Tasks
~12-15 tasks (to be refined before implementation)

# Phase 6: Semantic Layer

## Status
- [ ] Refinement complete
- [ ] Implementation in progress
- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase review complete

## Goal
Cloud provider abstraction layer mapping resources to unified concepts.

## Deliverables
- Semantic model definitions
- Cloud provider interface (abstract)
- Provider-to-semantic mapping engine
- Unified resource view API
- Semantic layer configuration
- Mapping visualization in frontend

## Dependencies
- Phase 5 complete (CMDB for storing mapped resources)

## Key Questions for Refinement
- What semantic concepts to support initially?
- How to handle unmappable provider-specific resources?
- Should mappings be configurable per tenant?
- How to handle mapping conflicts?

## Estimated Tasks
~6-8 tasks (to be refined before implementation)
